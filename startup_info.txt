   - Downloading HuggingFace models (~1.3GB)
   - Downloading NLTK data packages
   - Initializing ML libraries (PyTorch, Transformers)

2. SUBSEQUENT RUNS (Takes 30-60 seconds):
   - Loading cached models from disk
   - Initializing ML libraries

3. COMMON HANG POINTS:
   - "[MAIN] Importing HuggingFace and ML libraries..." (30-60 seconds)
   - "[EMBEDDINGS] Loading model..." (First run: 2-5 minutes)
   - "[MAIN] Downloading NLTK data..." (First run: 30 seconds)

4. WHAT'S BEING DOWNLOADED:
   - BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 embedding model (~1.3GB)
   - NLTK language data packages (~50MB)
   - PyTorch model dependencies

5. TROUBLESHOOTING:
   - Ensure stable internet connection
   - Check available disk space (need ~2GB free)
